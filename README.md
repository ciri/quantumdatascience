# Quantum Data Science

### **Intended audience**

This book is intended to be a primer on quantum mechanics and data science for the practitioner. This means that it's primary focus is on learning how to apply quantum machine learning methods for data science. Even so, we do include introductory chapters on quantum mechanics and chose to not sacrifice on rigour.

### **A collaborative open-source book**

#### Development

The field of Quantum Machine Learning is still quite scattered. The goal of this book is to gather knowledge related to quantum data science in one place in a  collaborative way in order to provide a boost to the community. This book will always be freely available online via github.

#### How to contribute

If you see potential chapters that this book would benefit from, feel free to start one. You are also welcome to make any minor or major change as you see fit including, but not limited to: fixing grammar or spelling errors, reviewing explanations or notations, adding suggestions, etc.

All commits are welcome! If you are unfamiliar with Github, you can email me your contributions via: enric.junquedefortuny (at) nyu (dot edu.


### **Software**

We use Python because it is the most popular language in use by data scientists today.
