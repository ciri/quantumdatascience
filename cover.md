# Quantum Data Science

**Intended audience**

This book is intended to be a primer on quantum mechanics and data science for the practitioner. This means that it's primary focus is on learning how to apply quantum machine learning methods for data science. Even so, we do include introductory chapters on quantum mechanics and chose to not sacrifice on rigour. 

**A collaborative book**

The field of Quantum Machine Learning/Data Science is still quite scattered. The goal of this book is to gather knowledge related to quantum data science in one place in a  collaborative way.

**Software**

We use Python because it is the most popular language in use by data scientists today.
